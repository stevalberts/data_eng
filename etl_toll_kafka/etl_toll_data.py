# Project: To de-congest the national highways by analyzing the road traffic data from different toll plazas. 
# As a vehicle passes a toll plaza, the vehicle's data like vehicle_id,vehicle_type,toll_plaza_id, and timestamp are streamed to Kafka. 
# Your task is to create a data pipe line that collects the streaming data and loads it into a database.


# Download and extract Kafka
# wget https://downloads.apache.org/kafka/3.7.0/kafka_2.12-3.7.0.tgz

# Extract Kafka from the zip file by running the command below.
# tar -xzf kafka_2.12-3.7.0.tgz
